					Six feet apart. Masks on. Disinfect. It has been a year
					since the pandemic has pushed people out of arm’s reach.
					This persistent distance and isolation has laid new
					pressures on people’s shoulders and tested the limits of
					once reliable social safety nets. Limiting avenues of self
					validation through in-person interpersonal connections.

					and family, for some, those connections wore thin as time
					wore on and created demand for something more substantial.
					Something more that could potentially be found through a
					window to the world framed by dating applications.

					phone had, prior to the pandemic, been complimented by
					hanging out in person.
