					Six feet apart. Masks on. Disinfect. It has been a year
					since the pandemic has pushed people out of arm’s reach.
				</p>
				<p>
					The impact of self-quarantine, isolation and physical
					distancing have taken a particularly hard toll on people
					aged 18 to 29. The connections built between friends, family
					and potential partners have been forced into an unfamiliar
					dynamic out of their control and, for over a year, without
					any end in sight.
				</p>
				<p>
					But there is a place they can find one another: dating apps.
				</p>
				<p>
					Apps, like
					<a href="https://bumble.com/" target="_blank">Bumble</a>,

					<a href="https://coffeemeetsbagel.com/" target="_blank"
						>Coffee Meets Bagel</a
					>, have become increasingly popular modes of communication
					and connection. Simply put, apps have offered an open window
					to the world that had previously felt closed by the
					pandemic.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, that desire to meet a match face-to-face is often
					in conflict with the need to be safe.

							<h1>Fighting Loneliness</h1>
							<p>
								The pandemic has exposed people to a new sort of
								loneliness. One that has, for some, blurred the
								lines between what it means to be lonely and
								what it means to be alone.
							</p>
							<p>
								“Often people talk about loneliness in terms of
								being alone,” explains New York City
								psychoanalyst Dr. Michael Chavis, “Loneliness
								and alone are not the same thing. To be alone is
								to be without anyone. To be lonely is to be

									By the summer, Hager had returned to dating

									restoring a sense of normalcy to his life.
									The risks of meeting someone new during the

									of simply waiting for the pandemic to end
									and the uncertainty involved was far less
									appealing.

									For young people like Erlene Tuazaon, a

									isn’t always easy to explain or reconcile.
								</p>

									“Since the pandemic started, I was pretty

									about the support and affection found in

								<h2>Realizing what's really important</h2>
								<p>
									Kacey Quenzer, a 27-year-old buyer for a
									national power company, felt isolated
									quickly into quarantine. “I’m a social
									person, but I was also going through a
									breakup right when it hit, so that made it
									harder,” she recalls.
								</p>
								<p>
									Even more, Quenzer had just moved into her
									own apartment – an accomplishment she
									celebrated, but also one that left her even
									more alone.
								</p>
								<p>
									She turned to dating apps, particularly
									Hinge, to find distraction from her breakup
									and to escape from the walls of her
									one-bedroom in South Boston.
								</p>
								<p>
									Unfortunately, she found it hard to make
									genuine connections on the app. Her
									surface-level or one-off interactions on the
									app made her “treasure the genuine
									connections” she’d already found in her
									life, “I’ve realized what matters more,” she
									stated.
								</p>
								<p>
									What mattered most, she now understood, was
									her previous relationship. Quenzer and her
									ex-boyfriend, who lives in England, began
									communicating again. “We talked on and off
									throughout quarantine, but I was guarded
									because I was so hurt by what we went
									through before.”
								</p>
								<p>
									In February of 2021, nearly a year into the
									pandemic, Quenzer had an epiphany. “I called
									him and told him I was all in.”

									Quenzer notes that quarantine gave her and
									her ex-boyfriend both the time they needed
									to really think about what they wanted and
									to be intentional about moving forward. “We
									both needed to do some work alone to make
									this work as a couple. I’m not sure we
									would’ve gotten there if life had kept on as
									normal.”
								</p>
								<p>
									In May, Quenzer will fly to England to
									reunite with him. They have a schedule of
									visits mapped out for the rest of the year.
									From there, they’ll figure the rest out,
									together.

									The pandemic has challenged long held
									notions of our relationships and how we
									connect. It has highlighted the issues born
									when self-esteem and self-validation are
									rooted in confirmation from others. And
									perhaps, for some, exposed the anxieties of
									being alone after having been alone for so
									long.
								</p>
								<p>
									“I think that people seek that kind of
									closeness, a direct love relationship, that
									grows out of an ongoing feeling of
									isolation. The wish to be with someone. To
									know you are with someone...They wish for
									that oneness because there's a kind of
									paranoia of being alone. That oneness is
									about fighting that paranoia. About fighting
									the fear that one is left without,” said Dr.
									Chavis.
								</p>
								<p>
									Whatever the “new normal” may look like for
									relationships after the pandemic, it’s clear
									that things will change. We will have to
									make new bridges where others have been
									eroded or forgotten. Further still, we will
									have to consider the means by which we make
									and maintain those bridges.
