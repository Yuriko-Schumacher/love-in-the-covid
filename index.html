								Six feet apart. Masks on. Disinfect. It has been
								a year since the pandemic has pushed people out
								of arm’s reach.
							</p>
							<p>
								This persistent distance and isolation has laid
								new pressures on people’s shoulders and tested
								the limits of once reliable social safety nets.
								Limiting avenues of self validation through
								in-person interpersonal connections.
							</p>
							<p>
								Even with technology bolstering the bridges
								between friends and family, for some, those
								connections wore thin as time wore on and
								created demand for something more substantial.
								Something more that could potentially be found
								through a window to the world framed by dating
								applications.
							</p>
							<p>
								The pandemic has created a new sort of
								isolation, a new sort of loneliness. Connecting
								with friends online or on the phone had, prior
								to the pandemic, been complimented by hanging
								out in person.
